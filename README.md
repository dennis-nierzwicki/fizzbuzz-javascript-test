# FizzBuzz Challenge

This project is part of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** curriculum.  
It's a simple implementation of the classic **FizzBuzz** problem using **JavaScript** to practice loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

---

## About the Project
FizzBuzz is a beginner-friendly programming challenge where you:
- Print numbers from `1` up to a user-specified number.
- Replace numbers divisible by `3` with **Fizz**.
- Replace numbers divisible by `5` with **Buzz**.
- Replace numbers divisible by **both** `3` and `5` with **FizzBuzz**.

This implementation also:
- Prompts the user for a number.
- Validates the input to ensure it’s an integer.
- Uses a `for` loop and conditional statements for logic.

## Features
- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter a number.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only whole numbers are accepted.
- **FizzBuzz Logic:** Outputs Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number itself.
- **Console Output:** Results are displayed in the browser console.
